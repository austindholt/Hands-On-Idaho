# Hands-On Idaho — v2 Final

Polished static site with your content, socials, favicon, and a logo filename fallback that works with either `logo.png` or `logo.PNG`.

## Deploy
1. Go to https://github.com/austindholt/hands-on-idaho
2. **Add file → Upload files** → drag everything from this folder.
3. Commit changes → wait ~1–2 minutes for GitHub Pages to refresh.

## Edit
- Replace `logo.png` with a new one anytime (uppercase `.PNG` works too).
- Update services in `services.html`.
- Swap portfolio placeholders in `portfolio.html`.
- Contact details are in `contact.html`.

## Troubleshooting
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R) if styling looks old.
- If using a custom domain, ensure A records point to GitHub Pages and HTTPS is enforced in **Settings → Pages**.
